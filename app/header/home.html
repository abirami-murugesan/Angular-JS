<p class="para-p">
  AngularJS is a client side JavaScript MVC framework to develop a dynamic web
  application. AngularJS was originally started as a project in Google but now,
  it is open source framework. AngularJS is entirely based on HTML and
  JavaScript, so there is no need to learn another syntax or language.
  tipAngularJS is also called just "Angular". AngularJS changes static HTML to
  dynamic HTML. It extends the ability of HTML by adding built-in attributes and
  components and also provides an ability to create custom attributes using
  simple JavaScript.
